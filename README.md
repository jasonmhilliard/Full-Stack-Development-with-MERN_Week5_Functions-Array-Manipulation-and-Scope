# Functions-Array-Manipulation-and-Scope
Week5: Functions Array Manipulation and Scope

I. File list
------------
Introduction to JavaScript- Variables, Arrays, Functions, Objects and Loops - Microsoft Word Document

ES6_Style_Guide - MD File

arrayManipulationExercise - JavaScript File


II. Concept
----------
The word document breaks down the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript code-  Variables, Arrays, Functions, Objects and Loops along with some small code examples for each that you can run in the developer tools in the browser console.

The ES6 Style Guide gives you proper syntax and style when you are coding. It is especially important to use the proper style when you are working on a development project with other team members.

The arrayManipulationExercise JS file allows you to manipulate arrays in JS using the array.slice and array.splice commands.


III. Future Improvements
----------
Expansion of the ES6 Style Guide. An excellent online reference for JS style guide is airbnb: https://airbnb.io/javascript/

Expansion of the arrayManipulationExercise to include other commands such as array.push and array.pop.

IV.  License

The source material for this repository contains information and code from the MITxPRO Full Stack Development with MERN 32 week bootcamp course.
As a student in the course, I have participated in reading the course materials and created my own code throughout all of the course projects. As a result I have provided my own additions, comments, material and code to the repositories along the way.
