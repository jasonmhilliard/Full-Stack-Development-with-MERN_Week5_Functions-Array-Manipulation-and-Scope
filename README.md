Week5: Functions Array Manipulation and Scope

I. File list
------------
Manipulating Arrays - Microsoft Word Document

arrayManipulationExercise - JavaScript File


II. Concept
----------
The word document desribes working with Arrays in JavaScript. An analagoy for an array in JS can be thought of as a library that holds books.  If you want to retreive a specific book from the libarary, you need to know the proper JS command.

The arrayManipulationExercise JS file allows you to manipulate arrays in JS using the array.slice and array.splice commands.


III. Future Improvements
----------
Expansion of the arrayManipulationExercise to include other commands such as array.push and array.pop.
